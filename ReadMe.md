# UCSD MLE MiniProject Logistic Regression
This repo was originally cloned from 
https://github.com/springboard-curriculum/mec2-projects/blob/main/Student_MLE_MiniProject_Logistic_Regression.ipynb

The work here extends that repo and represents orignal work submitted in satisfaction of assignment 19.3.7 - UCSD_MLE_MiniProject_Logistic_Regression

Here I have included a local directory to contain the data and created a local .venv to ensure better packaging and deployment in the future.

NOTE // THE PAIRPLOT FUNCTION REQUIRES COLAB LEVEL COMPUTE AND OFTEN TRIPS UP LOCAL INSTANCES // 
I have pasted a png of the pairplot created in COLAB to avoid this issue.

An immediately accessible version of the notebook is available at this link
